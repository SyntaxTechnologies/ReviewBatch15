Exception:
    Exception is an unwanted behaviour that occurs at runtime, and it terminates the
    program abruptly
There are three main types of issues in java programs:
    1)Syntax error 2) logical error 3) exception(runtime errors)
1) Syntax error:
    Syntax error occur when we do not follow the java syntax for example
    when we have to create a variable we must define its data type or use the var keyword
    if we don't do this we will get a syntax error.Syntax errors occur a time
    of writing code. They do not allow us to compile the code.
    How to Fix: use your IDEs to find and fix these issues
2) logical errors:
    Logical error occur when the programs don't do things that are supposed to do.
    for example, you write some code to click on a button but your program instead
    clicks on a checkbox or on some other button. you write code to print numbers
    from 0 to 10, but you program only prints 0 to 9.
    How to Fix: use the debugger
3) Exceptions(Runtime errors)
   Are the errors which are produced at runtime. here code compiles fine but the
   moment you try to run your program it throws errors.
   How to Fix: Read the error and take the help from the class whose exception is
   being thrown for example NullPointerException.
=======================================================
Exception Handling:
    Exception handling is finding and fixing runtime errors and coming up with
    ways to avoid these errors.

There are some keywords and blocks of code that we can use to avoid these exception.
1) we have 1)try 2) catch 3) finally 4) throws 5) throw.
try-catch block:
    helps us test the code by putting it inside the try block and if something goes wrong
    java executes the associated catch block where we can put backup code, or we can notify the admins.
