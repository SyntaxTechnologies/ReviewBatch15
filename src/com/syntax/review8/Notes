Overriding - process when same method exist in super and subclass
Why - to provide flexibility
How to implement
1. Inheritance
2. same signature (name+parameters)
3. same return type
4. access modifiers -> overriding method must have same level of visibility or higher

final - keyword that identifies something is completed and no modification can be done

final can be used with:
        variables - makes variable CONSTANT
        methods - cannot override it
        class - cannot be inherited

Abstraction - process of hiding implementation details and showing only functionality
Why - reduce complexity, improve maintainability and security

How to implement abstraction?
    By using Abstract classes - we can achieve 0 to 100% abstraction
    By using Interfaces - we can achieve 0 to 100% abstraction (before Java 8 it was only 100%)
